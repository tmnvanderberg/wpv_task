// This is the script file for the MIX trial randomizer

// Define the item source file
// it contains 160 trials in 1 block because 2 blocks at the same time caused the program to crash
// - 80 different combinations
// - 4 different cues per target (that's the conditions)

ItemFile items_in_blocks.txt

// - 20 different targets
// the target word is in the 2nd column
Property target 2

// the condition is in the 3rd column
Property condition 3

// 80 cues are in 1st column
//Property cue 1

// Define the constraints
// - balance between two halves
// - randomize according to the constraints over the entirety of trials, not just within each block
// - not the same cue or target within 8 trials of each other
Constraint target MinDist 8
Constraint condition MaxRep 2

// - transitions between conditions (i.e. cond.1 -> cond.2, or cond.2->1) need to be equal in number, there are 16 different transitions
// for half the trials (160) the max possible occurrence for each condition transition (i.e. each of the size-of-2 windows) is 160/16 = 10 
Constraint condition Pattern 10 2 

// count the occurrences for each target in a new column
Occurrence target

// - align output in columns
Comb 4

// Define the output files
// make sure that each of the items is twice in each half of the trial list
